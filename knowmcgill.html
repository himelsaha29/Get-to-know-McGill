      McGill University is a public research university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1821 by royal charter granted by King George IV,[9] the university bears the name of James McGill, a Scottish merchant whose bequest in 1813 formed the university's precursor, University of McGill College (or simply, McGill College); the name was officially changed to McGill University in 1885.
